# AllMightModel.github.io
This repository/site only allows the camera to be used on the phone. However, the model does not show up with the "hiro" marker provided with ar.js. 
I communicated with my partner about the issue of the model not showing up. We ended up deciding to keep working on this until Monday. If nothing was still working, 
then we would turn in this repository in the state it was at the time. 

Below is an example of the current version of the repository on scanning the "Hiro" marker on the phone.

As you can see, the model is not showing up, despite being shown the marker. This is the primary error that we got, and as far that we got on the assignment.
